            <h2><b>How to Prevent Fires in Your Home</b></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Fire safety in the home is of the greatest importance and there are a range of measures you can take to keep your family and home safe from fire. Here are some of the most important ones. Understanding what to do in the event of a fire is the cornerstone of fire safety. develop a fire evacuation plan for your home and ensure all family members understand what to do. As a fire can commence just about anywhere in the home, multiple exit strategies should be included. If you have deadlocks and security doors, you’ll want to make certain the keys are obtainable so that exit is not delayed or prevented. Explain to children the need to stay low to reduce smoke inhalation as they move towards an exit, and that they should never ever delay leaving to retrieve a pet, toy or other items. You’ll find plenty of detailed information online about creating a fire evacuation plan for your home. </p>

                          <h4>Unplug Things Not in Use</h4>
                          <p>Excess electricity flowing through items in your home can always be a potential fire hazard. Things like computers, TVs, game systems and a whole lot more use electricity even when they’re not on. That means they can always experience a surge or they can just overheat and cause a fire.

                        The continuous electricity that’s flowing into them provides them with a source for a fire as well. By unplugging these items when you’re not using them and, therefore, not paying attention to them, you can cut down on your chances of a fire.</p>

                          <p>At the very least, you want to make sure that all of your electronics are plugged into surge protectors. A surge in power is when you are most likely to experience an electrical fire and by plugging items into a surge protector you don’t have to worry about that excess electricity getting to the item and causing a fire.</p>

                          <p>If you’re cooking, lighting candles, or using any other type of flame or excessive heat, you want to make sure that you’re watching it at all times. If you start cooking anything, you never want to walk away from the stove. If you start a fire in your fireplace you want to make sure you keep an eye on that as well.

                          By keeping an eye on these types of flames you can recognize quickly if there’s a problem or if they aren’t the way they are supposed to be. </p>

                          You want to keep the stack of papers away from your wax melter. You also want to make sure that you’re watching closely for anything that could turn into a problem.</p>
